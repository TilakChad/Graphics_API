## Graphics API

A simple API that can be used to plot pixels on the screen. <br>
It can be used to visualize raster algorithms used in computer graphics. For example : Bressenham's line drawing algorithm, mid-point circle drawing algorithm or flood fill algorithms and anti-aliasing. <br>
<br>
It uses opengl as renderer and uses GLFW for context creation. <br>
<br>
It supports basic features like : <br>
Moving the grid left, right, top or down with directional arrow keys <br>
Zooming in and out with mouse scroll key <br>
Panning with left clicked and dragging <br>
Quiting with ESC Key :D <br><br>

A line drawn form (1,0) to (7,4) using DDA line drawing algorithm <br>
